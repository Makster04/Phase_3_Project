### 4. **Implementation Plan for One Week**

#### **Day 1-2: Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Gather data on cost of living, employment rates, crime rates, education, and healthcare.
- Preprocess the data by handling missing values and outliers.
- Engineer the target variable (categorical outcome) based on thresholds and rules.

#### **Day 3-4: Model Training & Experimentation**
- Split data into training and testing sets (80/20 split).
- Train multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost).
- Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score.

#### **Day 5: Model Tuning & Validation**
- Tune the models using hyperparameter optimization (if necessary).
- Validate the model on a test dataset to ensure itâ€™s generalizable.

#### **Day 6-7: Build Interface for User Input & Recommendations**
- Create a simple user interface where the user can input their preferences (income, family size, job sector, etc.).
- The model will classify cities based on the input, and the system will provide recommendations for suitable cities.
